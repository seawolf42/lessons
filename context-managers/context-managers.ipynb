    "# Context Managers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Many resources that your programs interact with have rules about how they are to be properly \"opened\" and \"closed\", wehre those words loosely represent the set-up and tear-down phases of the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you interact with a database, there are specific steps you should perform to *connect*, and specific steps you should perform to *disconnect*. Regardless of what you are doing in between, you need to always disconnect if you have successfully connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the pattern is well-known and exists in so many ways, the Python language offers a mechanism for ensuring both parts are executed correctly: **context managers**. A context manager is an object (or function decorator) that allows you to wrap your \"in between\" code in a code block that only starts if setup completes, and that guarantees tear-down regardless of how the block exits (normal return, exception, whatever).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Use\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows the use of a context manager that we are almost all very familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filename = 'data.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(filename, 'r') as fin:\n",
    "    data = fin.readlines()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That `with` statement is really telling Python that a context manager is about to create a context. The `open()` function is actually a context manager that returns a file handle. That handle is \"open\" inside the indented code block, and becomes \"closed\" when the code block exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rough steps that this context manager performs for you are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. call the low-level OS function to get a handle to the file\n",
    "1. put a wrapper around that handle that gives you access to functions on the file, like `read()`, `write()`, and `seek()`\n",
    "1. return the handle to the calling code\n",
    "1. ... do the work in the code block until either a value is returned or an exception propagates up ...\n",
    "1. call the low-level OS function to relenquish the handle to the file back to the available group\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing a Context Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first context manager will be simple: it will print a line of text before the inner block is executed and print another line of text when the inner block completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write context managers two ways, as a class or as a generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class-Based Context Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "The class approach is easier to understand, so we'll start there:"

    "\n",
    "A context manager is a very convenient mechanism for ensuring you properly release resources when you're done with them. While exception handlers *can* do the right thing, it becomes the responsibility of the *user* of the package to know what cleanup is required. By using a context manager, you as the package manager have the necessary knowledge to clean up all the resources used in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many context managers don't return anything at all, and this is completely reasonable for many use cases. But the majority of context managers return some kind of context object. For class-based, they sometimes return `self`, but a complex system might return an object that is not the context manager itself but is managed by it. Function-based context managers can also return any object, so using a complex object to describe everything that can be done within the context is not uncommon.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, note that it's a best practice to have your code objects each be responsible for a single thing. With this in mind, it's not unusual to have several context managers called together. For this, they can be nested:"
