    "## What Is Map/Reduce?\n",
    "\n",
    "Map/Reduce is a method of distributing processing across several CPUs. It shares concepts from multithreading on CPUs and parallel processing on GPUs but with one major difference: tasks are parallelized across machines in a cluster, and task coordination is such that compute units can be added or removed during a job without affecting the outcome. This means jobs can be scaled as-needed limited only by the availability of more computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of Map/Reduce is that most tasks can be split into two phases: a data filter/select/project (**map**) phase that is highly parallelizable and an aggregation (**reduce**) phase which is less so. Since the map phase involves the most heavy lifting and often involves loading each record of interest no matter how large the data set, it is spread across a cluster and only summarized or interim results are returned and processed further. The reduce phase involves collecting the raw output from mapping and collating or summarizing that data into values that directly or indirectly answer the question at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example is counting words in a set of documents. Assuming the documents look like this:\n",
